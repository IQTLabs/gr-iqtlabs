flags: [python, cpp]
documentation: |-
  This block simulates a tuneable radio source, that emits samples
  that are constant based on requested frequency, and tagged with
  that frequency (generally, for testing blocks that require interactively
  retuning a source).

  inputs:
    cmd: accepts PMT tuning commands (same format as Soapy sources, "rx_freq").
  output:
    complex samples proportional to frequency.

  parameters:
    freq_divisor: value to divide requested frequency by, to produce samples.

templates:
  imports: from gnuradio import iqtlabs
  make: iqtlabs.tuneable_test_source(${freq_divisor})
